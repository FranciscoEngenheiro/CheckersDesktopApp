A regular checker (Piece) can be upgraded to King if it reaches the first row of the board on the opponent's side.
A Piece can only move diagonally in a forward direction (towards the opponent), whereas a King can move forwards and backwards.
A King can't jump over the same color checkers or the opponent's checkers if they're in contiguous diagonal squares meanwhile it can jump over contiguous empty diagonal squares.
Only when a piece is in a close diagonal of an opponent's checker and there is an empty black square in the same diagonal, then a capture can be made.
The opponent's checker gets eliminated after a successful capture.
A Piece can perform a backwards capture.
The player who crowns a Piece (to a King) loses its turn, even if there are more captures to be made from that position.
The process of capturing with a King is identical to that of capturing with a Piece, except it is not necessary for the start and finish squares, in the same diagonal, to be near the opponent checker that will be jumped.
A King cannot jump its own color checkers.
To continue with the game, a capture must be made if one is available.
The player may select which capture to make if there are more than one available at the beginning of its turn.
